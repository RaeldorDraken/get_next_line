Trying out the read function
and seeing if it changes line or
not!
This is a very long line, I don't know what else to put in here but I must put enough characters tp go over 256 characters on a single line. Maybe putting the numbers as letters will be sufficient: two-hundred and fifty-six characters. Sadly, it is not :(
